Productive 4.0 - Sweden Demo
================================

**Live Liquidity Forecasting** â€” Using GPS tracking, a distributed ledger and advanced probability analytics, we're creating the next generation liquidity forecasting tool. The goal of this `Productive 4.0 <https://productive40.eu/>`_ demonstrator is to track the whereabouts of **Volvo truck engines** along with their state in the **supply-chain**. This information will be matched with corresponding **truck purchase orders**, in order to generate a live liquidity forecast (FX exposure).

In short: Industry 4.0 meets Bank 4.0.
